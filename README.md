#SVGs beyond mere shapes
##### The entire interactive presentation

In this repo you can find the slides and underlying code for the presentation that I gave at OpenVis in Boston on April 25th, 2016. It might take a few seconds to load, but you should see something within Â±5 seconds. Note that the presentation has a few CPU heavy slides, especially those with continuously moving objects

Tested with Chrome, Firefox and Safari, but definitely meant to be seen in Chrome. Even more so at a resolution of 1920x1080
